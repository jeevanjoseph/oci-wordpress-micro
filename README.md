# oci-wordpress-micro

## Prerequisites

- Permission to `manage` the following types of resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy: `vcns`, `internet-gateways`, `route-tables`, `security-lists`, `subnets` and `instances`.

- Quota to create the following resources: 1 VCN, 1 subnet, 1 Internet Gateway, and 1 compute instance (Wordpress CMS).

If you don't have the required permissions and quota, contact your tenancy administrator. See [Policy Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm), [Service Limits](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm), [Compartment Quotas](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).

## Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager


## Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

### Clone the Module

Now, you'll want a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

```
    git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-arch-wordpress-mds.git
    cd oci-arch-wordpress-mds
    ls
```

### Prerequisites
First off, you'll need to do some pre-deploy setup.  That's all detailed [here](https://github.com/cloud-partners/oci-prerequisites).

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file, and specify the following variables:

```
# Authentication
tenancy_ocid         = "<tenancy_ocid>"
user_ocid            = "<user_ocid>"
fingerprint          = "<finger_print>"
private_key_path     = "<pem_private_key_path>"

# Region
region = "<oci_region>"

# Availablity Domain 
availablity_domain_name = "<availablity_domain_name>"

````

### Create the Resources
Run the following commands:

    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply


### Testing your Deployment
After the deployment is finished, you can access WP-Admin by picking wordpress_wp-admin_url output and pasting into web browser window. You can also verify initial content of your blog by using wordpress_public_ip:

````
wordpress_wp-admin_url = http://193.122.198.19/wp-admin/
wordpress_public_ip = 193.122.198.19
`````

### Destroy the Deployment
When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy the resources:

    terraform destroy
